- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeffj1111. Those 1's were just a spur of the moment choice back in Ancient Times when Gmail accounts were still just by invitation... I've been there, done that, got the team coffee mugs and shirts, and am still learning, every day.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... creating my next career as a remote-working guru, solving problems for people & making the world a better place. From home. With my dogs. And garden.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... game development while developing CRM solutions for non-profits helping at-risk populations. Day job is DBA in state government (for the great health insurance & something called 'retirement'...?).
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any number of things.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
